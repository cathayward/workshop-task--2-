### workshop task 2

- i decided that for this task i wanted to create something using stars that appear at intervals to create the image of a night sky
- i found a tutorial online that highlighted the key ideas on how to make a star and by using and slightly altering their function i was able to create a star shape that i liked. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSp5iSTXwAY)
- one issue i did run into was the function wasn’t running within setInterval or setTimeout, in order to get it to work i created a separate function that used my specific values for the stars and then it ran perfectly.
- this solution was provided to me with the help of chatgpt which i used because i was completely stumped as to why my function wasn't cooperating
- i hit a wall when trying to figure out the count function and couldn’t quite figure out how to get the stars to stop showing up once there was 100 stars on screen, i want to keep looking through this code to see if i can make that work.
- going back to the video from workshop two, i utilised the code shown in order to create a clearInterval command so that the stars would stop appearing once they reached a count on 100
- i also changed the width and height parameters as i noticed stars were appearing off the screen when i didn't want them to
